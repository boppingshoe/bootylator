\title{Estimate survivals, detections, and tally adult returns}
\usage{
surv_calc(ch, i, nocc, wt, wt_i, phi_p_only, fpc, match_bt4, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ch}{Input file made by \code{format_dat()} function.}

\item{i}{Iteration number used by the bootstrap function \code{bootystrapper()}.}

\item{nocc}{Total detection events including the trawl.}

\item{wt}{Indicates whether to weight the sampling probability.}

\item{wt_i}{Indicates whether to calculate the original estimates using weighted probability.}

\item{phi_p_only}{Option to only calculate survivals and detection and not do the adult counts.}

\item{fpc}{Option to adapt finite population correction for survival and detection calculations.}

\item{match_bt4}{Option to follow the procedures used by BT4 program. BT4 excludes mini-jacks for both adult and juvenile removal counts. If one choosed no ("n"), mini-jacks would be included in the juvenile removal counts.}
}
\value{
Survivals, detection and returing adult counts
